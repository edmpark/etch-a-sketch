# etch-a-sketch

On mouse hover will color each grid item gray. There is also a button that clears grid and creates a new grid of your size choice.
The grid was created using CSS grid and using Javascipt DOM for the button to work.

I am capable of putting in random color (or even something to choose color manually) or having opacity increased to a color after every 10 blocks are colored but it has not been added in yet. Does get a bit slow for large numbers inputted.
